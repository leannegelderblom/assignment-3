    "During the Great Recession many European economies saw steep increases in the  unemployment rate (see this [Table from OECD data](https://data.oecd.org/chart/4v74)). With job finding rates low and more long-term unemployment, governments might expand the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits to ease economic pain for the unemployed and reduce the shortfall in aggregate demand [(Moffit 2014, p.5)](http://wol.iza.org/articles/unemployment-benefits-and-unemployment.pdf/). One way is to lengthen the duration of the benefit period, the effects of which have already been surveyed by [Tatsiramos and Van Ours (2012)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12005/abstract). A second option for governments is to increase the benefit level during a recession, which may be more effective in keeping up aggregate demand in the short-term. Benefit levels are commonly measured by the net income replacement rate, the ratio of benefits to the recepients earnings on the terminated job [(Moffit 2014, p.3)](http://wol.iza.org/articles/unemployment-benefits-and-unemployment.pdf/).\n",
    "\n",
    "But any adjustment to the generosity of benefits must balance the improvement in welfare with expected side-effects, the most important of which is moral hazard among job-seekers. An increase in the replacement rate reduces the gains from taking a job during the benefit period and benefit recepients might lower their search effort in response. This could slow down a recovery [(Moffit 2014, p.6)](http://wol.iza.org/articles/unemployment-benefits-and-unemployment.pdf/). We therefore ask what would be the effect of an increase in the replacement rate on the following labor market outcomes and welfare measures: search intensity, the value of unemployment, unemployment duration and the job finding rate.\n"

    "We use a two-sided search-matching model of a dynamic labor market from [Boeri and Van Ours (2013, sec 11.9)](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10142.html), which is a simplified version of the model used by [Boone and Van Ours (2006)](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mohr/jite/2006/00000162/00000002/art00001/), to simulate the overall effects of a change in the replacement rate. Our model is limited in the sense that unemployement is caused by search frictions rather than demand. Moreover, because the model does not include a feedback loop from changes in the replacement rate to prodcut market demand, our work here is limited to an analysis of partial equilibrium.\n",

We calculate the relative change in GDP per unit worked and compare labor market outcomes under both states of the business cycle.
